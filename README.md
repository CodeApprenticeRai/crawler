# Crawler
Node webpage -> .txt converter.  Name and idea proposed by Khalid Al-Awady


-----
## Focus
Ultimate Outcome:
-  A node.js script that takes a url as an argument, and scrapes the text of the page, and saves that text to a .txt file.

Other Intents:
- A graph link analysis tool for showing how separated two wikipedia articles are. It is supposed that every wikipedia article is connected to every other aticle by the Philosophy article. If this is true, a web application can be created that does a search for the connection between two given articles, and a visualization can be generated that shows the build process of the graph. Would be an interesting project.

## Work Involved / Outcome Sequences

- Accept URL as program input, 15 mins
- Validate URL, 30 mins
- Make a request for the html of the page and get a response, 1hr
- Save response as a .txt file, 15 mins

Total Time Required: 2 hours
